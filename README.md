# Embi

Work in progress: Embi is an IDE for editing images in a programmatic fashion.
The key tool Embi provides is a domain-specific language, Embil, that allows the
user to manipulate visual elements on a canvas in a swift and extremely precise
manner.

Note: everything in this repository pertains to a toy version of Embi, i.e. one 
that is intentionally small and limited in scope but still demonstrates some core
aspects.
